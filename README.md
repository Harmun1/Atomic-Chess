# Atomic-Chess
Slight variant of chess board game. Pieces move and caputure the same as standard chess, but there is no check or checkmate, as well as no castling, en passant, or pawn promotion.
If a player's king is captured or blown up, the game ends, and that player loses. The board locations are specified using algebraic notation. Columns are labeled a-h and rows are labeled 1-8. 
For atomic chess, when a piece is captured, an "explosion" occurs that will also capture the 8 squares that immediately surround the captured piece. This explosion will capture all pieces except pawns. 
The piece that is capturing will also be sacrificed when capturing an opponent's piece. Neither king piece can make a capture, and both kings cannot be captured at the same time, within the same vicinity of
an explosion.
